# esp-ota-nimble-wx-mp

A running demo, implementing OTA on ESP devices that runs NimBLE stack by transmitting data from a Wechat MiniProgram.

The demo is quite basic that NO security or integrity check was done, only the basic packet transmission & OTA update functionalities were implemented.

I open-sourced this as it took me quite a time to grasp online demos but all those repo/examples are not quite an re-usable solution that can fit in any existing mode of code organization.

This demo was mostly generated by Claude-3.5-sonnet (New), with manual correction and debug. So this demo is simple (and even crude) that it has NO code optimization, NO coding style regulation, and it's definitely still far from a production level thing.

Please use it at your own risk.



## Usage

This demo uses the [esp-nimble-cpp](https://github.com/h2zero/esp-nimble-cpp) library as a component for handling the complicated APIs of the NimBLE stack. Please ensure this library has been install as a component before compiling the ESP-IDF code.

Please use ESP-IDF V5.3 as the current sdkconfig might not be compatible with previous versions of ESP-IDF.
